The application would be coded with Java. For linting we would use the build-in tools in an IDE like Intellij. Building the project would be done by Apache Maven and testing by JUnit.

There are plenty of alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions such as Azure, GitLab CI, Bamboo and CircleCI.

For this project we would probably go with a cloud-based setup because our team is fairly small and we are only working on this one project. Setting up our own self-hosted system would require more initial work, which our team, working intensively on our soon to be released application, really cannot spare. Our team also does not have a lot of experience with CI/CD, hence the gentler learning curve of a cloud-based system is valuable to us. It is true that a self-hosted system would have more scalability and flexibility in the future. However, as we have not launched our application yet, that future is very unsure. In addition, we feel that our application is not that complex that we would really benefit from the customization options of a self-hosted system. The cost differences between the systems also play a part in our decision, at the moment we are not flush with cash which makes the lower initial cost of the cloud-based setup attractive, although we must keep in mind that if our application grows quickly the cost of a self-hosted system would probably be lower in the long run.
